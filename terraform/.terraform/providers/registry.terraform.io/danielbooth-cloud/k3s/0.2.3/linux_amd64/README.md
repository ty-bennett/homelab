## Description

> **⚠️ This library is currently under active development. Features and APIs may change without notice. Use with caution in production environments.**

Manage your [k3s](https://k3s.io) clusters with terraform. Much of this provider is a reimplementation of [k3s-ansible](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s-ansible) into terraform
resources so you can manage you k3s clusters together with your cloud provider of choice (or baremetal). This provider is cloud agnostic, but is tested on Openstack.
